        Musk was born in Pretoria to Maye (née Haldeman),
         a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University 
         of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his
          Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in 
          Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's 
          degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, 
          but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide 
          software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same 
          year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. 
          In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made 
          from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.
